example player for war of game (http://warofgame.online || http://github.com/rranshous/war_of_game)

to test:

you must have docker installed
your user must be able to use docker without sudo (join the docker group!)
clone this repo to your disk
run: bundle install
run: test_player_against rranshous/wog_player

after some short instructions you'll begin to see the this bot play
a game against the bot rranshous/wog_player

both players act randomly so it will be a slow game
(for more amusing games check out rranshous/wog_player_attack)
